      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Lateef Graham, also known as <strong>Specto</strong>. I’m a Computer Science major at NJCU, gamer, and streamer. 
        Purple Harvest is my way of connecting with my Warlocks community and sharing my love of gaming and tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive on blending technical mastery with creative polish — whether I’m building predictive models, refining documentation, 
        or crafting immersive web and game experiences. Persistence, clarity, and creativity guide my work, and I’m always iterating until the vision matches the magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purple Harvest is more than a site — it’s a growing world where technology and imagination meet. 
        Here, I merge interactive design, streaming integration, and enchanted storytelling to create a space that feels alive and welcoming.
